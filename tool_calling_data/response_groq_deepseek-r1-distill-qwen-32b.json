I need to figure out how to respond. I remember that I have a function called get_weather that can help with this. The function requires a location parameter, which should be a string like \"city, state\". \n\nSo, I should extract the location from the user's query. The user mentioned \"San Francisco\", but I need to make sure if they meant the city in California. I'll assume it's San Francisco, CA unless specified otherwise. \n\nI'll structure the function call with the location as \"San Francisco, CA\". That should provide the necessary information to get the current weather. I'll make sure to format it correctly in JSON as per the instructions.\n"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"queue_time":0.253327109,"prompt_tokens":130,"prompt_time":0.008566694,"completion_tokens":186,"completion_time":1.3285714290000001,"total_tokens":316,"total_time":1.337138123},"system_fingerprint":"fp_d458a8aba5","x_groq":{"id":"req_01jnhth08xf3fahmbbcw03j23m"}}
